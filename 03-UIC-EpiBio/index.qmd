graphs of exponential growth with log and linear scales?

[300 participants completed all 3 experiments]{.fragment .emph .cerulean}

::: notes
I'm a huge fan of lineups, but one of the issues I had with the COVID graphs I was seeing was that I wasn't convinced people were *interpreting* the data correctly.

I started thinking about why lineups wouldn't test things at the level I was hoping for, and eventually came up with this hierarchy - first, you have to be able to recognize that there is a difference between two things. Then, you have to be able to predict and forecast to map "data from the past" onto the future. Finally, you have to actually be able to read data off of the graph and act on it - doing numerical calculations and the like.

These are distinct psychological tasks, and they require different ways of interacting with a chart. So I'm going to describe 3 experiments that we've conducted relating to log scales.

These experiments were inspired by COVID, but we worked hard to not go anywhere near COVID data because while we were designing these experiments, it was a bit emotionally loaded. Even now that pandemic measures have ended, it's still too politically sensitive to touch, so we'll continue using non-covid data on follow-up studies.

![Linear Scale](fig/linear-lineup-example.png)
:::

::: notes
Our first level of engagement is basic perception - can we actually distinguish different growth rates/levels of curvature on a linear and log scale. This is the most basic thing -- if we can't do this, then we probably won't be able to predict things well or read information off the graph well (though, that last point is arguable).

-   Factorial Experiment:
    -   Log/linear scale (2 levels)
    -   Lineup composition: (6 levels)
        -   Target plot - high, medium, low curvature
        -   Null plots - high, medium, low curvature
        -   Exclude combinations where target/null are the same
    -   Low/High variability (2 levels)
-   Included 6 Rorschach plots (3 curvature levels x log or linear scale)

[12 lineups + 1 Rorshcach plots = 13 evaluations per person]{.emph .cerulean}

Here are a couple of example lineups from this experiment - the first is on a linear scale, the 2nd is on a log scale. While I generally tried throughout these experiments to make it clear that we were on a log scale, it is a very subtle difference in these lineups, and fixing that wasn't necessarily relevant to the question at hand -- since all sub-panels have the same axis breaks, we're actually testing whether we can distinguish the data, not the scales.

[Conclusion:]{.emph .cerulean} It's easier to spot a curve among lines than it is to spot a line among curves

@robinsonPerceptionCognitiveImplications2023 [ ]{.smaller}\[[Under review]{.smaller}\]

::: notes
We used a generalized linear mixed effects model to assess the probability of a correct target identification given factors like target and null plot type, participant skill level, and random effects due to the data generating process. The plot shown here is the resulting log odds ratio for log vs. linear scales, and we see that it is easier to detect curvature among a field of null lines than it is to detect linearity among a field of curved lines. In addition, we see that when there is a lot of contrast between the null and the target plot, that is, when the nulls are very curved and the target is very straight, there isn't much difference between the two graphs. However, if there is less contrast, the log scale allows us to perceive the differences better than the linear scale.

-   Log scales make us more sensitive to slight changes in curvature:
    -   Low Curvature Null vs. Medium Curvature Target on log scale is curve vs. line\
        (it's hard to see the straight-line target vs. the curved nulls)
    -   With Medium or High curvature Null plots, it's easier to spot the target on the log scale than on the linear scale

::: notes
There have been a number of statistical experiments with "eye fitting" regression models. The first was driven by the desire to reduce computation time; the second is much more psychological in nature. That study had students line up a transparency with a straight line on it to fit a regression line to some data. They found that students tended to fit the slope of the first PC rather than the least squares line.

More recently, The New York Times has used a really cool setup to have people predict data before showing them the actual trend. They use javascript and have people draw directly on the plot. The line can be curved, jagged, etc. - it's not restricted to a strictly linear set-up. We decided to adopt this approach because we didn't want to impose a specific functional form, because it's not totally clear that people are thinking exponentially or are actually good at drawing exponential curves.

The methods changed a bit, but the basic concept is the same.

## Q2: Forecasting (You-Draw-It) Goals

1.  Replicate Eye Fitting Straight Lines using the you-draw-it tool (4 charts) @robinsonEyeFittingStraight2022

2.  Explore exponential growth predictions on log and linear scale (8 charts)

    -   Points end 50% or 75% of the way across x-axis
    -   Rate of growth of $\beta$ = 0.1, 0.23
    -   Log or Linear scale

[12 total graphs to complete]{.emph .cerulean .large}

::: notes
First, we wanted to validate the "Eye fitting straight lines" method using You Draw it, by using datasets from the 1981 study, on the original linear scale. This would serve as a validation of the method and also help us test out our analysis method on data that was a bit more straightforward.

Then, the (main) goal is to see how terrible we are at predicting exponential growth when using a log scale and a linear scale.

We set things up with varying amounts of data -- so you have data to base your regression line up to either halfway or 3/4 of the way through the graph, and you have to then extend beyond the data by 25% or 50%.

We used two different rates of growth, and then either had a graph with a log or linear scale.

If you're keeping track, then there are 4 straight lines, and 8 sets of exponential data (generated on the fly from basic parameters). We saved both the data shown on the plot and the drawn smooth lines.

::: notes
Here, I'm showing you the actual drawn lines for each of the exponential conditions, and you can see that there are a few interesting features:

1.  Not everyone drew very smooth lines -- we probably need to do some data cleaning based on the number of sharp "jumps" in the data -- possibly excluding those cases or smoothing over them.

2.  The amount of deviation in the final prediction value is (surprisingly) not much larger when there is less data -- this was really shocking for me

3.  Linear scale predictions seem to be lower than log scale predictions, in particular when beta is higher -- it's not that noticeable when beta is low. So the under-prediction bias is stronger for linear scales than it is for log scales. That doesn't necessarily mean that everyone underpredicts, but you do see way more orange lines on top in the lower right panel.

If we look at the residuals instead, we see that there is still some under-prediction even with the log scale when beta is high, but our basic conclusions from the original plots still hold.

We can make this even clearer by modeling the residuals using a generalized additive model, which has a flexible form and doesn't require too many assumptions about model structure.

## Q3: Numerical Estimation

-   Next level of engagement is estimating quantities from a graph

-   This is a much harder experiment to set up

    -   Phrasing matters a lot!
    -   Data matters a lot!

[How to make it generalizable?]{.center .large .emph .cerulean}

::: notes
One of my favorite parts of graphical inference is that it totally sidesteps this question of phrasing by encoding all of what would have been verbal questions into the graph itself.

This really is a huge improvement over past graphical methods -- there were studies showing that pie charts sucked from the early 1900s, but they were hampered by the generalizability of the questions - if you asked for someone to estimate the percentage of a pie slice, you got different conclusions than if you asked someone to make a judgement between two pieces of the pie.

::: notes
-   in dataset 1, both points were close to the underlying value, and the estimates bear that out.

-   in dataset 2, one point was a bit of an outlier, and so we can see different estimation strategies appear: some participants answered using an overall trend/visual regression, while others answered using actual points.\

::: notes
-   When we look only at people who answered in a reasonable range given the question (e.g. didn't assume we meant additive estimation), we see a lot of variability and a few more things to look into here - such as why there's a peak in dataset 1 that is around 15, even though the closest point and the true value are both near 10.

## Q3: Numerical Estimation

How many times more creatures are there in `Year2` than `Year1`?

![](fig/03-05-boxplots-true.png)

::: notes
-   As the questions get more mathematically complex, we also see that participants start using model-based strategies for estimation - they don't have the mental bandwidth to hold all of the estimates for specific points, arithmatic, etc. in their heads, so they take shortcuts like working off of a mental trendline.

-   Here, for the first time, the true deviation (deviation from the underling model) is a better match to participant estimates than the closest point deviation.
