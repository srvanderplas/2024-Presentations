	abstract = {One of the fundamental tasks in visualization is to compare two or more visual elements. However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences ({JNDs}), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between {JNDs} and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on {JND} for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model {JND} and find that {JND} grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the {JND} modeling in which elements below the fitted {JND} are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.},

This study adds to a growing body of research within technical communication that addresses the use of think-aloud protocols in usability test settings. The eye movements and verbalizations of 10 participants were recorded as they searched for information on a website. The analysis of transcripts and real-time eye movement showed that {CTA} is an accurate data-collection method. The researcher found that the majority of user verbalizations in the study included words, phrases, and sentences that users read from the screen. Silence and verbal fillers that occurred during {CTA} enabled users to assess and process information during their searches. This study demonstrates the value technical communicators add to the study of usability test methods, and the paper recommends future avenues of research.},

By comparing subjects‚Äô verbalizations with their eye movements, we found stimulated {RTA} to be valid and reliable: the method provides a valid account of what people attended to in completing tasks, it has a low risk of introducing fabrications, and its validity is unaffected by task complexity. More detailed analysis of {RTA} shows that it also provides additional information about user‚Äôs inferences and strategies in completing tasks. The findings of this study provide valuable support for usability practitioners to use {RTA} and to trust the users‚Äô performance information collected by this method in a usability study.},

	abstract = {We investigate task performance and reading characteristics for scatterplots (Cartesian coordinates) and parallel coordinates. In a controlled eye-tracking study, we asked 24 participants to assess the relative distance of points in multidimensional space, depending on the diagram type (parallel coordinates or a horizontal collection of scatterplots), the number of data dimensions (2, 4, 6, or 8), and the relative distance between points (15\%, 20\%, or 25\%). For a given reference point and two target points, we instructed participants to choose the target point that was closer to the reference point in multidimensional space. We present a visual scanning model that describes different strategies to solve this retrieval task for both diagram types, and propose corresponding hypotheses that we test using task completion time, accuracy, and gaze positions as dependent variables. Our results show that scatterplots outperform parallel coordinates significantly in 2 dimensions, however, the task was solved more quickly and more accurately with parallel coordinates in 8 dimensions. The eye-tracking data further shows significant differences between Cartesian and parallel coordinates, as well as between different numbers of dimensions. For parallel coordinates, there is a clear trend toward shorter fixations and longer saccades with increasing number of dimensions. Using an area-of-interest ({AOI}) based approach, we identify different reading strategies for each diagram type: For parallel coordinates, the participants‚Äô gaze frequently jumped back and forth between pairs of axes, while axes were rarely focused on when viewing Cartesian coordinates. We further found that participants‚Äô attention is biased: toward the center of the whole plot for parallel coordinates and skewed to the center/left side for Cartesian coordinates. We anticipate that these results may support the design of more effective visualizations for multidimensional data.},

	abstract = {In online education, the appropriate choice of means of knowledge visualization can reduce cognitive load and improve cognitive efficiency. However, no universal basis for selection can cause confusion in the pedagogical context. This study used the revised Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy to combine the types of knowledge with cognitive goals. We used a course on marketing research as an example to summarize the choices for visualizing factual knowledge ({FK}), conceptual knowledge ({CK}), procedural knowledge ({PK}), and metacognitive knowledge ({MK}) through four experiments. Visualized cognitive stages were used to determine the cognitive efficiencies of visualization for different knowledge types. In this stage, eye tracking is used for collecting eye movement indicators to measure cognitive load. The cognitive goals stage is used to get cognitive goals of the means of knowledge visualization. Combining the two stages, we get the conclusions as follows: Teachers and students can mostly benefit from presenting {FK} and {CK} points via mind maps. Using mind maps to teach {FK} online could be indirectly beneficial for improving students‚Äô creativity. Concept maps may be chosen for this point if the linked knowledge points are {PK} and the achievement of the analytical objective is emphasized in the student‚Äôs knowledge points. The flowchart can be used to display {PK}, while timelines could be utilized if the {PK} point is to be presented in a temporal dimension. Teachers should choose the curve area chart to display {MK}. A pie chart might be chosen and added more instructions. The findings suggest that mind maps are very effective¬†as a means of knowledge¬†visualization  in online education. In the meantime, it suggests that overly simplistic graphs increase cognitive load, while it also raises the possibility that redundant information in the text may increase cognitive load.},

To assess graphic effectiveness, eye tracking methods can help provide a deeper understanding of scanning strategies that underlie more traditional, high-level accuracy and task completion time results. Eye tracking methods entail many challenges, such as defining fixations, assigning fixations to areas of interest, choosing appropriate metrics, addressing potential errors in gaze location, and handling scanning interruptions. Special considerations are also required designing, preparing, and conducting eye tracking studies. An illustrative eye tracking study was conducted to assess the differences in scanning within and between bar, line, and spider graphs, to determine which graphs best support relative comparisons along several dimensions. There was excessive scanning to locate the correct bar graph in easier tasks. Scanning across bar and line graph dimensions before comparing across graphs was evident in harder tasks. There was repeated scanning between the same dimension of two spider graphs, implying a greater cognitive demand from scanning in a circle that contains multiple linear dimensions, than from scanning the linear axes of bar and line graphs. With appropriate task design and targeted analysis metrics, eye tracking techniques can illuminate visual scanning patterns hidden by more traditional time and accuracy results.},

Three theories were evaluated: Ericsson and Kintsch‚Äôs (Psychol Rev 102:211‚Äì245, 1995) theory of long-term working memory, Haider and Frensch‚Äôs (J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cognit 25:172‚Äì190, 1999) information-reduction hypothesis, and the holistic model of image perception of Kundel et al. (Radiology 242:396‚Äì402, 2007). Eye movement and performance data were cumulated from 819 experts, 187 intermediates, and 893 novices. In support of the evaluated theories, experts, when compared with non-experts, had shorter fixation durations, more fixations on task-relevant areas, and fewer fixations on task-redundant areas; experts also had longer saccades and shorter times to first fixate relevant information, owing to superiority in parafoveal processing and selective attention allocation. Eye movements, reaction time, and performance accuracy were moderated by characteristics of visualization (dynamics, realism, dimensionality, modality, and text annotation), task (complexity, time-on-task, and task control), and domain (sports, medicine, transportation, other). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of visual expertise in professional domains and their significance for the design of learning environments.},

For this state-of-the-art report, we investigated about 110 research papers presenting visualization techniques for eye tracking data. We classified these visualization techniques and identified two main categories: point-based methods and methods based on areas of interest. Additionally, we conducted an expert review asking leading eye tracking experts how they apply visualization techniques in their analysis of eye tracking data. Based on the experts' feedback, we identified challenges that have to be tackled in the future so that visualizations will become even more widely applied in eye tracking research.},

	abstract = {An eye tracking methodology can help uncover subtle cognitive processing stages that are otherwise difficult to observe in visualization evaluation studies. Pros and cons of eye tracking methods are discussed here, including common analysis metrics. One example metric is the initial time at which all elements of a visualization that are required to complete a task have been viewed. An illustrative eye tracking study was conducted to compare how radial and linear graphs support value lookup tasks for both one and two data-dimensions. Linear and radial versions of bar, line, area, and scatter graphs were presented to 32 participants, who each completed a counterbalanced series of tasks. Tasks were completed more quickly on linear graphs than on those with a radial layout. Scanpath analysis revealed that a three-stage processing model was supported: (1) find desired data dimension, (2) find its datapoint, and (3) map the datapoint to its value. Mapping a datapoint to its value was slower on radial than linear graphs, probably because eyes need to follow a circular, as opposed to a linear path. Finding a datapoint within a dimension was harder using line and area graphs than bar and scatter graphs, possibly due to visual confusion of the line representing a data series. Although few errors were made, eye tracking was also used here to classify error strategies. As a result of these analyses, guidelines are proposed for the design of radial and linear graphs.},

The experiment included a comparison of several plot types, histogram, density, scatterplot and dotplot for two group data, and the use of side-by-side boxplots and scatterplots for assessing the importance of predictors in a regression model. Results are compared with those from a larger visual inference study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The eye-tracker can be manageably used only on a small sample of people, to give detailed information plot about reading behavior, so it is ideally used prior to a large human subjects study to help refine the experimental procedures, or as a post-processing step to better understand any surprises in the results.},

	abstract = {In visual depictions of data, position (i.e., the vertical height of a line or a bar) is believed to be the most precise way to encode information compared to other encodings (e.g., hue). Not only are other encodings less precise than position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). By comparison, position‚Äôs high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. In contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a short delay. In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of average positions were signiÔ¨Åcantly biased, such that line positions were underestimated and bar positions were overestimated. In displays with multiple data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias still persisted. We also observed an effect of ‚Äúperceptual pull‚Äù, where the average position estimate for each series was ‚Äòpulled‚Äô toward the other. These Ô¨Åndings suggest that, although position may still be the most precise form of visual data encoding, it can also be systematically biased.},

	abstract = {Interactive display systems give users flexibility to tailor their visual displays to different tasks and situations. However, in order for such flexibility to be beneficial, users need to understand how to tailor displays to different tasks (to possess 'metarepresentational competence'). Recent research suggests that people may desire more complex and realistic displays than are most effective (Smallman \& St. John, 2005). In Experiment 1, undergraduate students were tested on a comprehension task with geospatial displays (weather maps) that varied in the number of extraneous variables displayed. Their metacognitive judgments about the relative effectiveness of the displays were also solicited. Extraneous variables slowed response time and increased errors, but participants favored complex maps that looked more realistic about one third of the time. In Experiment 2, the eye fixations of undergraduate students were monitored as they performed the comprehension task. Complex maps that looked more realistic led to more eye fixations on both task-relevant and task-irrelevant regions of the displays. Experiment 3 compared performance of experienced meteorologists and undergraduate students on the comprehension and metacognitive tasks. Meteorologists were as likely as undergraduate students to prefer geographically complex (realistic) displays and more likely than undergraduates to opt for displays that added extraneous weather variables. However, meteorologists were also slower and less accurate with complex than with simple displays. This work highlights the importance of empirically testing principles of visual display design and suggests some limits to metarepresentational competence.

	abstract = {Visualizations-visual representations of information, depicted in graphics-are studied by researchers in numerous ways, ranging from the study of the basic principles of creating visualizations, to the cognitive processes underlying their use, as well as how visualizations communicate complex information (such as in medical risk or spatial patterns). However, findings from different domains are rarely shared across domains though there may be domain-general principles underlying visualizations and their use. The limited cross-domain communication may be due to a lack of a unifying cognitive framework. This review aims to address this gap by proposing an integrative model that is grounded in models of visualization comprehension and a dual-process account of decision making. We review empirical studies of decision making with static two-dimensional visualizations motivated by a wide range of research goals and find significant direct and indirect support for a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations. Consistent with a dual-process model, the first type of visualization decision mechanism produces fast, easy, and computationally light decisions with visualizations. The second facilitates slower, more contemplative, and effortful decisions with visualizations. We illustrate the utility of a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations using four cross-domain findings that may constitute universal visualization principles. Further, we offer guidance for future research, including novel areas of exploration and practical recommendations for visualization designers based on cognitive theory and empirical findings.},

Hierarchical linear models allow a representation of structural levels in a statistical modeling framework. Diagnostic tools are used to assess the quality of model estimation and explore features of the data not well described by the model. Residual and influence diagnostics are familiar tools for the classical regression model with independent observations. For hierarchical linear models, these diagnostic tools must be adjusted to reflect the dependence introduced by the nested data structure. Residual analysis now includes the assessment of distributional assumptions at each level of the model. This requires the use of level-dependent residual quantities. Similarly, the parameter estimates may be influenced at each level of the model, requiring influence diagnostics that can pinpoint specific levels of the model, as well as specific aspects of the model. We present an overview of the diagnostic tools available for hierarchical linear models that are familiar from linear models. Additionally, we discuss the utility of the lineup protocol for residual analysis with complex models. {WIREs} Comput Stat 2013, 5:48‚Äì61. doi: 10.1002/wics.1238 This article is categorized under: Statistical Models {\textgreater} Bayesian Models Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis {\textgreater} Bayesian Methods and Theory Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis {\textgreater} Modeling Methods and Algorithms Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis {\textgreater} Statistical Graphics and Visualization},

Participants were presented with a series of plots and asked to identify the panel that appeared most different from the others. Due to the choice of scale altering the contextual appearance of the data, the results revealed slight perceptual advantages for both scales depending on the curvatures of the compared data. This study serves as the initial part of a three-paper series dedicated to understanding the perceptual and cognitive implications of using logarithmic scales for visualizing exponentially increasing data.
