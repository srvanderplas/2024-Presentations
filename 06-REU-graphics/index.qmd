## Information Overload

(Yes, the blog this chart is taken from is satirical. This is *not* a recommended graphical form.)


# Designing Good Charts

## Why Graphics Matter


Graphics are a form of **external cognition** that allow us to think about the *data* rather than the *chart*.

That is, graphics are a tool to make it easier for us to think about what the data means.

Good graphics take advantage of how the brain works, leveraging

-   preattentive processing

-   perceptual grouping

-   awareness of visual limitations

Good graphics also depend on the data: the chart type should be chosen based on the types of variables you want to display, the amount of data you have, and the results you want to highlight.

## Example: Hertzsprung Russell Diagram

```{r HR-diagram}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5
#| out-width: "100%"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "The Hertzsprung Russell diagram. Discovered independently by Ejnar Hertzsprung (1873–1967) and Henry Norris Russell (1877–1957). The diagram plots the color index of the star against the brightness (absolute magnitude) of the star. As a result, it is possible to discern that these two variables are related and change together over a star's life cycle: a hypothesis that only came to be because of this chart."
#| fig-alt: "A scatter plot showing the color index of a star on the x-axis and the absolute magnitude (brightness) of the star on the y-axis. Points are colored by spectral class, which varies from blue to white to yellow to red as the color index increases and the star's temperature decreases. Points are primarily located along a downward-sloping line from the top left to the bottom right, which is labeled the 'main sequence'. There is another set of points which diverges from the main sequence and extends out horizontally in the middle of the graph; these are labeled 'giants', and a few outliers that are above the giant cluster are labeled 'supergiants'. Below the main sequence stars, there are outliers which are labeled 'dwarfs'."

I've used data from the [HYG Database](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database) to generate this chart.
Only stars within 500 AU are shown.

::: notes

John Tukey, a famous statistician often considered the father of statistical graphics, wrote in Exploratory Data Analysis (1977):

> The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.


-   What variables are mapped to the following chart dimensions?

    -   X location
    -   Y location
    -   color

-   What other information is present on the chart that is not specifically a data value?

-   What does this chart do well?

-   What design features "work"?

-   What don't you like?

## Preattentive Perception


-   Occurs automatically (no effort)

-   Color, shape, angle

-   Combinations of preattentive features require attention

    -   Double-encoding (using multiple features for the same variable) is ok

#|   - "Color"
