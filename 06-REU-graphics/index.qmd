# Designing Good Charts

## Why Graphics Matter {.r-fit-text}

Graphics are a form of **external cognition** that allow us to think about the *data* rather than the *chart*.

That is, graphics are a tool to make it easier for us to think about what the data means.

Good graphics take advantage of how the brain works, leveraging

-   preattentive processing

-   perceptual grouping

-   awareness of visual limitations

Good graphics also depend on the data: the chart type should be chosen based on the types of variables you want to display, the amount of data you have, and the results you want to highlight.

## Example: Hertzsprung Russell Diagram {.r-fit-text}

```{r HR-diagram}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5
#| out-width: "100%"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "The Hertzsprung Russell diagram. Discovered independently by Ejnar Hertzsprung (1873–1967) and Henry Norris Russell (1877–1957). The diagram plots the color index of the star against the brightness (absolute magnitude) of the star. As a result, it is possible to discern that these two variables are related and change together over a star's life cycle: a hypothesis that only came to be because of this chart."
#| fig-alt: "A scatter plot showing the color index of a star on the x-axis and the absolute magnitude (brightness) of the star on the y-axis. Points are colored by spectral class, which varies from blue to white to yellow to red as the color index increases and the star's temperature decreases. Points are primarily located along a downward-sloping line from the top left to the bottom right, which is labeled the 'main sequence'. There is another set of points which diverges from the main sequence and extends out horizontally in the middle of the graph; these are labeled 'giants', and a few outliers that are above the giant cluster are labeled 'supergiants'. Below the main sequence stars, there are outliers which are labeled 'dwarfs'."

I've used data from the [HYG Database](https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database) to generate this chart. Only stars within 500 AU are shown.

::: notes
John Tukey, a famous statistician often considered the father of statistical graphics, wrote in Exploratory Data Analysis (1977):

> The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.

-   What variables are mapped to the following chart dimensions?

    -   X location
    -   Y location
    -   color

-   What other information is present on the chart that is not specifically a data value?

-   What does this chart do well?

-   What design features "work"?

-   What don't you like?

## Perceptual Grouping {.r-fit-text}

![](gestalt.jpg){fig-alt="An image reading 'GESTALT', where each letter demonstrates a principle of gestalt grouping. G has a white stripe over it, demonstrating closure - the stripe and the G are perceived as separate objects. E is shown as a grid of black squares, with grey squares making up the background; this demonstrates proximity - small objects close together are perceived as being part of the same whole. A bar is woven through the S shape, showing good continuation - the S is perceived as a continuous object that is behind the bar in the middle portion. The two Ts are striped and indicate similarity - they are similarly shaped and patterned and can be perceived as a group. The AL are connected, and the inside of the A seems to have a white tree in the middle, demonstrating figure/ground. The final T is part of the similarity group."}

# Perceptual Limitations

## Color {.r-fit-text}

- 10% of XY  and 0.2% of XX have color deficiency

- Avoid rainbow color schemes
  - unequal perception of different colors (we see more shades of green) = misleading idea of distance
  
  - avoid "stoplight" color schemes
  
## Color {.r-fit-text}
- Strategies
  - double encoding (color + shape or linetype)
  - make it work with black and white printers
  - use monochromatic (single color) gradients where possible
  - if you use bidirectional scale (e.g. blue to red), go through white or light yellow
  

## Color
- Be conscious of what some colors "mean" to use implicit understandings

- Avoid pink = female, blue = male

## Working Memory

- you can remember between 5 and 9 (7 plus or minus 2) things without writing them down

- Avoid legends that have more than 7 categories


## Accessibility {.r-fit-text}

- Provide alt-text for your charts that describe the important information as well as the data source and how it is represented

- Use larger text to make it easy for people with vis deficiencies to read

- Some fonts are easier for people with dyslexia to read -- if you're working with someone with dyslexia, ask them what font they prefer.
