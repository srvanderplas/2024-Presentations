# Perception and Dimensionality

## @clevelandGraphicalPerceptionTheory1984

![Figure 4, Cleveland & McGill (1984). Different types of comparisons with bar charts.](CM-comparisons.png)

- Hierarchy of visual features: 
  - Accuracy for length > area > volume
  - Experiments manipulated position and angle    
  (no actual area/volume experiments)

- Type 1 vs. 3 comparisons: cognitive grouping

## @zacksReadingBarGraphs1998

![Common Graph Types. (Modified from Figure 2)](DepthCues.png)

- Matching task: higher error on volume than area

- Estimation task: Error for volume >  line > area

# Experiment: Is 3D that bad?

![](designsvg.svg)

## Participants

- Integrated into introductory statistics classes:    
Summer 23, Fall 23, Spring 24

- Online students: 
  - 2D, 
  - 3D Fixed, 
  - 3D rendered

- In person students: 
  - 2D,
  - 3D Fixed, (Spring 24)
  - 3D Rendered, 
  - 3D printed

## Process 

Integrated into the course to align with current topics

  0. Informed Consent
  1. Reflection: process of scientific research
  2. experiment participation
  3. Reflection: experiment purpose, hypothesis, error, variables, randomization 
  4. Reflection: what students learned from 2-page abstract
  5. Reflection: How 15 minute conference presentation differed from abstract

# Student Responses


## Hypotheses

- "Students will get progressively less accurate as questions were asked"
- "Do students change their answers when asked the same question over and over?"
- "3D printed bar charts will lead to more accurate ratio judgments compared to 2D or 3D digital charts."
- "That 2d is preferred over 3d. It cleans up the data presentation."
- "The public can more accurately understand data when it is provided to them in a 2-D graph format."



## Sources of Error

- "Fatigue effect over the course of making many judgments, learning patterns from seeing the same ratios multiple times, possibly difference in eyesight among participants."
- "There are no line values to help measure it when there is a small difference between the graphs."
- "People that are guessing"
- "People in the sample misunderstanding directions."

## Elements of Experimental Design

- "I believe every graph was randomized for every student. I also believe the practice was meant to be a bit of the control group."
- "Randomization was used as participants all received different sets of graphs to examine. A person wasn't assigned to a certain set of graphs and it was up to random chance on which set of graphs they received."
- "I think that there is randomization but not a control group in my opinion, because there isn't one group that is left alone or not studied...."
- "Randomization was not used because it was offered as an extra credit assignment in class."
