abstract: |
  Regression experts consistently recommend plotting residuals for model diagnosis, 
  despite the availability of many numerical hypothesis test procedures designed to 
  use residuals to assess problems with a model fit. Here we provide evidence for 
  why this is good advice using data from a visual inference experiment. 
  We show how conventional tests are too sensitive, which means that too often 
  the conclusion would be that the model fit is inadequate. The experiment uses 
  the lineup protocol which puts a residual plot in the context of null plots. 
  This helps generate reliable and consistent reading of residual plots for better 
  model diagnosis. It can also help in an obverse situation where a conventional 
  test would fail to detect a problem with a model due to contaminated data. 
  The lineup protocol also detects a range of departures from good residuals 
  simultaneously.
