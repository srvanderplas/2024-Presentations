Fully updated in this new sixth edition, the distinguished authors have included new material on generalized regression techniques and new examples to help the reader understand retain the concepts taught in the book. The new edition focuses on four key areas of improvement over the fifth edition: New exercises and data sets New material on generalized regression techniques The inclusion of {JMP} software in key areas Carefully condensing the text where possible Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis skillfully blends theory and application in both the conventional and less common uses of regression analysis in today’s cutting-edge scientific research. The text equips readers to understand the basic principles needed to apply regression model-building techniques in various fields of study, including engineering, management, and the health sciences.},

	abstract = {Statistical inference provides the protocols for conducting rigorous science, but data plots provide the opportunity to discover the unexpected. These disparate endeavors are bridged by visual inference, where a lineup protocol can be employed for statistical testing. Human observers are needed to assess the lineups, typically using a crowd-sourcing service. This paper describes a new approach for computing statistical signiﬁcance associated with the results from applying a lineup protocol. It utilizes a Dirichlet distribution to accommodate diﬀerent levels of visual interest in individual null panels. The suggested procedures facilitate statistical inference for a broader range of data problems.},
